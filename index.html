			<h2>Getting Re-Acquainted with Amateur Radio</h2>
			<p>April 4, 2020</p>
			<p>Author: Colton Ancell, KE5DXX</p>
			<h3>Worldwide Panic</h3>
			<p>
				It's been a strange last several weeks.
			</p>
			<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has taken not just the country, but the world, by storm. Whole sports seasons have been cancelled,
				businesses are being forced to close by local and state governments, and the President is on TV daily with a “task force”
				to brief the American public on the current state of affairs. People are being told to shelter in place at home,
				preventing them from assembling in crowds at concerts, sports venues, parks, conferences, and other events. It’s a scary
				time to be alive. People are losing their jobs as the economy effectively grinds to a halt.
			</p>
			<p>
				It’s hard not to look at everything happening and wonder what the future might look like. I can say with confidence that
				it’s maybe only the second time during my life that I can honestly say I’m not positive about what is to come in the next
				several weeks or months. That realization had me thinking about how I can best prepare for worst-case scenarios, which
				led me back to amateur radio.
			</p>
			<h3>Returning to Radio</h3>
			<p>
				Amateur radio (or ham radio) has been a hobby of mine for over half of my life now. In February of 2005 at 14 years old, I
				took the exam to receive my Technician class license in Lubbock, TX. A few weeks passed and the FCC equipped me with my very
				own call sign, KE5DXX. It was an incredible stroke of luck, as “DX” is a common abbreviation in the hobby to signify long
				distance contacts. I was gifted an old 2m mobile station, and after obtaining a power supply and an antenna I was set up in
				the shed behind our home and was making CQ calls on the simplex calling frequency at 146.520 MHz. I had no idea what I was
				doing.
			</p>
			<p>
				My original motivation for becoming a ham was to join the local SKYWARN team. It was a group of volunteers who did storm
				spotting for the local National Weather Service office during severe weather events, and it was appealing to me because
				ever since living in central Oklahoma I was infatuated with severe weather and the idea of “storm chasing”. Ham radio
				was my gateway to joining the team, since they communicated primarily via amateur radio and a system of linked repeaters
				across west Texas.
			</p>
			<p>
				That 2m radio was followed by my very first mobile station, a Yaesu FT-8800R dual-band, dual-receive transceiver that I
				rigged up into my 2001 Ford F-150. I also purchased an Icom IC-T90A HT transceiver (tri-band on 6m, 2m, and 70cm) and would
				take that to my high school classes so that, when the SKYWARN weather briefings were held on the net repeater every day
				at noon, I could step outside and listen in to prepare for the severe weather that would be inevitable later in the day.
			</p>
			<p>
				When I began college at Texas Tech University, I carried both radios with me. I began meeting members of the amateur
				radio club at the school and even participated in a weather balloon fox hunt at one point. That, coupled with my dad’s
				interest in radio over the years, began to open up my eyes to the possibilities of the hobby. However, as I’m sure many
				readers may be familiar with, school, work, and life got in the way of my hobby.
			</p>
			<p>
				I left school in 2014 to take up restaurant management, which carried me first to El Paso, TX and then eventually into
				central Texas around the Austin area. Working a full-time job and being in new environments caused me to fall out of
				the hobby. I got a new car in which I never remounted my mobile unit and it sat in a box for several years. Somehow
				the HT transceiver survived, and the 2m mobile station was lost along the way somewhere (along with that original
				vertically-polarized 2m antenna that wasn’t easily mounted in an apartment.)
			</p>
			<p>
				The radios gathered dust and fell to the wayside as I focused on my career and occasional dabbling in other hobbies
				like computer programming. About a year or so ago I purchased a C. Crane CC Skywave SSB shortwave radio and began to
				explore radio again. Then, the Coronavirus pandemic hit and had me thinking about emergency communications again.
			</p>
			<h3>What's Next?</h3>
			<p>
				I’m now down to just my HT unit, the Yaesu being lost (actually, I’m pretty sure I threw it away, which I’ll never
				forgive myself for or understand) and I’ve decided it’s time to get back into things. I’m now studying for the General
				class upgrade, learning Morse code, and exploring my next mobile radio (and/or HF unit).
			</p>
			<p>
				I’ve joined the Amateur Radio Relay League (ARRL) as a member and have been exploring all of the new technologies
				available to amateurs, including digital modes like D-STAR, FT8, and DMR as well as finding interest in older
				technologies like CW and RTTY.
			</p>
			<p>
				Getting back into things will present its own challenges. I’m still living in an apartment (for a few more months)
				and have a limited supply of cash to purchase new equipment (saving up for the house!) Additionally, with COVID-19
				putting the whole country on lock down, there are not any VEs administering any exams at the moment. This will either
				give me plenty of time to study for General or maybe even General and Extra class upgrades.
			</p>
			<p>
				I’m starting this blog to document my journey and share it with other hams across the country. Ham radio is such an
				awesome endeavor, but it is often seen as the hobby for an older generation, one that was limited to radio for
				communication as opposed to the tools of the internet and digital world that we have today. I’m in the camp of
				believers that thinks radio and digital technology doesn’t have to be mutually exclusive, and that amateur radio can
				evolve to match the interests and needs of society today just as it has done over the last 100+ years.
			</p>
			<p>
				I won’t pretend to be an expert in radio communication. There will always be more to learn and more avenues of the
				art to explore. But I hope that I can show a younger generation how this hobby can be both fun, challenging, and
				enriching. I’ll make mistakes and I’ll learn new things, and my hope is that I can share it with all of you along the
				way.
			</p>

				These are my Adventures in Amateur Radio.
